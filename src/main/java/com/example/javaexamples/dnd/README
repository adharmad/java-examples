Programming using DND:-
It is like programming any other GUI feature. There are events and listeners.
Drag start events, drag source events and drop events. To play with these,
we need to implement the corresponding listener interfaces. 
eg - To respond to a dropped object, create an event handler that 
implements the DropTargetListener interface.

There are 3 mail sources to work with -
1) A drop target - Accepts an incoming drag. The process of accepting the
   dragged information generates a series of events that you can respond to.
2) A drag recognizer - An event adapter that listens for events that indicate
   that a drag has started.
3) A drag source -
